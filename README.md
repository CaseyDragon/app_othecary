# APPothecary

An app created for helping soapmakers create and manage their soap recipes.

## Getting Started

This app is currently available here:
[heroku app](https://polar-anchorage-48953.herokuapp.com/)


## Built With

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
* [PostGres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)


## User Stories
When using this app a soapmaker will be able to calculate the volume of a mold so they know how much oil is needed. Then they can calculate a soap recipe with proper lye calculations done based on the saponification value of each oil. The app also includes some basic formulations for other skincare products. 


## Wireframes



## Struggles



## Future Plans

I plan to build out the database to include for oils and more oil properties. I also would like to include safe useage for additives such as essential oils and fragrances.
